  (:documentation "Wayland primitive data communication.

Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients.
The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, or an X application, or a Wayland client itself.
The clients can be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen), or other display servers.

The wayland-wire package defines utilities for communicating primitive data through a fast-io buffer connected to a Wayland UNIX socket stream."))
